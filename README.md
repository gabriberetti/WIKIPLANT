## Description ## 
A 3D world map with a open source database of all plants and their BioData in MIDI format, accessible to everyone, for any kind of artistic or scientific-research purpose of sonifications. 

## Interface ##
By rotating the 3D world map, zooming in the geographic area and clicking on the desired plant (or after finding it simply using the filter searchbar), a list of available MIDI files for download are shown, with a set of parameters or "Impressions" linked to the file and are used as parameters for filter searchbar, for quick analysis of the state of the plant and to have a general guideline of the kind of BioData contained in the MIDI files.

## BioData Characteristics or Impressions ##
- Name of the plant and general infos
- Date & Time of recording
- Geographic area of the plant/recording
- Health conditions of the plant

## Requirements ##
- Databate of all plants (+Google?)
- Database Cloud storage for uploading MIDI files
- Built-in generative audio sampler for quick preview
- Filter searchbar (using Impressions parameters)
- During upload process, pinpoint on Google map for a quick geolocation of the recording
- 

## Goals ##
- Raise awareness
- Create a big impact in the future of electronic arts 
- Offer a service which at the moment doesnÂ´t exist

## Thoughts ##
- Possibly in a couple of years, we would have a library of BioData and people will have the chance to study and work with plants without having to travel and record it themselves.
