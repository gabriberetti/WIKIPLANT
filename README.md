## Description ## 
A 3D world map with a open source database of all plants and their BioData in MIDI format, accessible to everyone, for any kind of artistic or scientific-research purpose of sonifications. 

## Interface ##
By rotating the 3D world map, zooming in the geographic area and clicking on the desired plant (or after finding it simply using the filter searchbar), a set of characteristics or Impressions are shown up and can be used as parameters for filter searchbar, for quick analysis of the state of the plant and the MIDI files.

## BioData Characteristics or Impressions ##
- Name of the plant / General short info
- Geographic area of the plant recording
- Health and general conditions of the plant
- Date & Time of recording

## Requirements ##
- Databate of all plants (+Google?)
- Built-in generative audio/video sample
- Filter searchbar using Impressions parameters
- Pinpoint on Google map for a quick geolocation

## Goals ##
- Raise awareness
- Create a big impact in the future of electronic arts 
- Offer a service which at the moment doesnÂ´t exist

## Thoughts ##
- Possibly in a couple of years, we would have a library of BioData and people will have the chance to study and work with plants without having to travel and record it themselves.
