# WIKIPLANTS or WIKIBIODATA

## Description ## 
A 3D world map with a open source database of all plants and their BioData in MIDI format, accessible to everyone, for any kind of artistic or scientific-research purpose of sonifications. 

## Interface ##
By rotating the 3D world map, zooming in the geographic area and clicking on the desired plant (or after finding it simply using the filter searchbar), a list of available MIDI files for download are shown, with a set of parameters or "Impressions" linked to the file, which are used as parameters for filter searchbar, for quick analysis of the state of the plant and to have a general guideline of the kind of BioData contained in the MIDI files.
As open source database, users can upload the BioData in MIDI files on the website. Following the guidelines of the parameters "Impressions", a detailed library would possibly flourish as more users would upload their BioData. Possibly in a couple of years, we would have a library of plants BioData and users could download and use the MIDI for studies, researches, sonifications and so on.  

## BioData Characteristics or Impressions ##
- Name of the plant, family
- Date & Time of recording
- Geographic area of the plant/recording
- Health conditions of the plant

## Requirements ##
- Home page with 3D worldmap view
- Databate of all plants (+Google recognition for uploading?)
- Database Cloud storage for uploading and storage of BioData MIDI files
- Built-in generative audio sampler for quick preview
- Filter searchbar (using Impressions parameters)
- During upload process, pinpoint on Google map for a quick geolocation of the recording

## Goals ##
- Raise awareness
- Create a big impact in the future of electronic arts and helping new arts to be formed and recognised
- Help researchers and scientists collecting and studyng BioData of plants for human services
- Offer a free and open-source platform which at the moment doesn´t exist
